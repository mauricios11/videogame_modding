## 📝 Prerequisites

Before you begin, you need to have two essential tools installed.

- ✅ **Fluffy Mod Manager:** The tool we'll use to install the mod.
  - Download it from the **[official website](https://www.fluffyquack.com/)**.
  - Create a new folder anywhere on your computer, and unzip the Mod Manager files into it.

- ✅ **REFramework:** A script extender required for many Dragon's Dogma 2 mods.
  - Download the `DD2.zip` file from the **[latest REFramework release](https://github.com/praydog/REFramework-nightly/releases)**.
  - **Do not unzip this file yet!** We'll use it later.

## 🛠️ Installation Steps

> [!NOTE]
> ### 🔍 Step-by-Step Guide
>
> 1.  Find and run **Modmanager.exe** from the folder where you unzipped it.
>
> 2.  The first time you run it, it will ask you to select a game. Choose **Dragon's Dogma 2** from the list.
>
> 3.  Now, drag and drop the `DD2.zip` file (the REFramework you downloaded) directly into the Mod Manager window to install it.
>
> 4.  Next, go to this mod's **[Releases Page](https://github.com/mauricios11/videogame_modding/releases/latest)** and download the `.zip` or `.rar` file of the version you want.
>
> 5.  Just like before, drag and drop your downloaded mod file (e.g., `physics_enhanced.rar`) directly into the Mod Manager window.
>     > **⚠️WARNING⚠️ Do not unzip the mod file itself.** The Mod Manager needs the original `.zip` or `.rar` file.
>
> 6.  You should now see both REFramework and my physics mod in the list. Click the checkbox next to my mod to activate it.
>
> 7.  That's it! Launch the game and enjoy the new physics.
